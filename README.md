# Boston airbnb data analysis


This project requires the installation of folium for mapping as well as importing pandas, numpy, os, matplotlib and multiple sklearn models.

The purpose of the project is to better understand the drivers of Airbnb rental prices.

In this repository, you will find my python notebook (airbnb).  The data for this project was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston.

This project helped me determine that the major drivers of pricing is the neighborhood/location and the type of property that is being offered. These factors impact the pricing more than the amenities or even the number of people the location accomodates.
